Hi, my name is Jesse Dorey-Ferrera.

I am an trained economist with a passion for banking, technology and analytics. I recieved my Masters of Arts in Economics from American University in 2010. I spent the majority of my time at American researching international economics, including the Federal Reserve's dollar liquidity swap program and soverign debt. After a few months of living in Mexico City I entered the world of community banking in an effort to learn the microeconomics of debt and how banks lend to real world businesses. This developed into an interest into credit risk managment and financial risk management in general.
